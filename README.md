# Video-Game-Sales-Data-Analysis-SQL-Project
This project involves cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a video game sales dataset using SQL. The goal is to uncover business insights about platform trends, genre performance, regional sales distribution, and publisher dominance.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- Data contains sales information for video games across North America, Japan, and PAL regions.
- Fields include: `title`, `genre`, `console`, `publisher`, `developer`, `release_date`, `critic_score`, `total_sales`, and more.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Removed duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs.
- Cleaned inconsistent publisher names (e.g., “Namco Bandai” → “Bandai Namco”).
- Converted columns to appropriate types (e.g., `critic_score` to `DECIMAL`, dates to `DATE`).
- Handled NULLs in `critic_score` and `release_date`.
